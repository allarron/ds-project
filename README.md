Analysing the overhyped games and their flops/failure(Random Forest)

We are going to do the two-step analysis.
1st, analysing games that were overhyped before their release and reason of their failure/downfall. What are the common aspects that influenced failure

2nd, how do failed games impact/affect the the reputation of game studios/companies and future releases.

The algorithm we will be using:
1)the clustering method will be used to identify more significant causes of failure.

2)several well-known games will be considered, each game will be examined using the decision tree algorithm to identify the relationship between failures and the future reputation. Random forest algorithm will generate all trees.
